[Pratt SAVI](https://commons.pratt.edu/savi/) 780--Introduction to Interactive Web Mapping, Programming and Design--is an introduction to the languages and techniques used in modern web map development.

Students were asked to create final projects using techniques covered in the
course on a topic of interest, whether that interest was personal or for future
research. We're excited to share the end products with you, which explore a
diverse span of locations, topic areas, and mapping techniques.
