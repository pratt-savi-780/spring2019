Which Ways was built as a model for future projects using Leaflet. Separating the road network into different categories offers the user a different way of looking at a city. The site filters the street centerline dataset by different street suffixes, zooms to a fixed view, and pulls street and borough name data to display in a sidebar. Using a relatively straightforward dataset allowed me to focus on the site's design and user interface - I wanted to limit myself to only a few colors, to use transparency effectively, and to create an intuitive user experience. I want to use this model and the solutions I learned for future projects with more varieties of data types and layers. I would also like to add a function to this site to allow the user to filter roads by year, visualizing the construction of the city's road network over time.
