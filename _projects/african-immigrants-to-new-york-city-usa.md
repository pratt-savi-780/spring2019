In January of 2018 the PEW Research organization published an article about the increase of black immigrants to the USA. One significant increase was immigrants from Africa. Of the ten countries listed in the PEW article, eight of these countries are in Africa. Because of my African Ancestry, I thought many would share my interest of identifying with immigrants from their countries of origin residing in NY City.

I made this map to make available information that could be helpful to African Immigrant populations residing in and out of NY City. As this group is very diverse, this information can be helpful for cultural, academic research, health initiatives and philanthropy to list a few reasons.
Ultimately, this map would provide sufficient information to assist with helpful information, such as demographics representing groups of specific countries, tribal affiliation and culture, local associations etc.

Additionally, other features such as searchable information of academic institutions located in boroughs, subway transportation information, housing, international airports, and other related services will be added.
