tagline: "On my last visit to Guyana, I decided that I would do some exploring since, despite having grown up there, I haven’t been to many places.   Even though the country’s tourism website has a lot of information, it was still somewhat taxing researching attractions one at a time. I created this map to with the hope that it would provide the average traveler with a tool that would allow for easier means of researching and arranging tours. "
